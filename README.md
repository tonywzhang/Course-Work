# Introduction to Software Testing or Software QA

### Notes

Positive Testing:
  Testing Software to test if it works as intended
  Basic Functionality
Negative Testing:
  Testing Software trying to break it
  Testing to cause an error
  Testing to render an error message

Common Terminology:
  Regression Testing
  Smoke Testing
  Black Box Testing
  White Box Testing
  Gray Box Testing
  Test Cases
  Use Cases

Black Box Testing
  No Knowledge of Code Needed
  No Access to the Source Code
  Use Product as a user and report any errors

White Box Testing
  Need Knowledge of Coding
  Tester has access to Source Code
  Dig in to code and identify location of the bug

Gray Box Testing
  Implements Manual Testing
  No Access to source code
  Knows how the components of the applications work
  Technical, but not as much as white box testing


SLDC Lifecycle

1) Planning
2) Define Requirements
3) Design &  Prototyping
4) Software Development
5) Testing
6) Deployment
7) Operations & Maintenance

Testing Purpose

Testing is the process of verifying and validating that software is bug free, meets all requirements with handling all the exceptional and boundary cases.

Validation: Have we built the product correctly according to the need of the customer?
Verification: Are we building the product the right way?

Testing

Prioritization: Not everything will be fixed in one sprint, so what issues should take priority?
Bug Reporting: Monitoring and Tracking the status/history of bugs
Bug Hunting: Ad-Hoc Against the Requirements
Test Cases: Writing, executing, and reporting
Story Testing: Against requirements, Bug hunting, and Test cases writing

Software bugs

An error, flaw, or fault in a program that causes it to product either an incorrect or unexpected result

Examples of some bugs

Design, Functionality, Spelling, Compatibility, Localization, Performance, Usability, and Security


Functional Testing

System is tested against the functional requirements/specifications

Compatibility Testing

Checking to see whether Software is capable of running on different hardware, operating systems, applications, network environments or mobile devices

Performance Testing

Determining the speed, responsiveness, and stability of a software program or device under a workload

Usability Testing

Used to evaluate how easy a website is to use: User Experience (UI)

Security Testing

Testing technique used to determine if an information system protects data and maintains functionality as intended


How to Log Errors in JIRA

2) Summary
3) Description
4) Steps to Reproduce bugs

Severity vs Priority

Severity is defined as the degree of impact on the development or application

Priority is defined as the order in which a defect should be fixed.
